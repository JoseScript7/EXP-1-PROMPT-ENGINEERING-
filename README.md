## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm (What the System Did)

Step 1: Loaded the provided sample IEEE-format PDF to extract its layout structure (margins, two-column formatting, title style, section hierarchy).


Step 2: Converted your full Generative AI + LLM content into a structured semantic outline (chapters, subsections, tables, equations).


Step 3: Mapped each section of your content to the exact IEEE template sections, preserving numbering and formatting.


Step 4: Generated an IEEE-compliant LaTeX file (\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}) replicating the sample PDF’s layout.


Step 5: Inserted your content into the LaTeX document—adding tables, math, citations, and formatting directives.


Step 6: Exported the final .tex file and prepared it for compilation into a two-column IEEE PDF.

## Output
https://github.com/JoseScript7/EXP-1-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-/blob/main/Generative_AI_Report.pdf 


## Result (2 Lines)

The experiment successfully generated an IEEE-style two-column research report on Generative AI and LLMs.
